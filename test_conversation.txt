Account Manager: Hello, thank you for your interest in our services. How can I assist you today?

Client: Hi, I'm looking to improve our team's communication skills and wanted to know more about your training programs.

Account Manager: That's excellent! I'd be happy to discuss our communication training solutions. Can you tell me a bit about your current challenges?

Client: Well, our account managers sometimes struggle with active listening and building rapport with clients.

Account Manager: I understand. Those are critical skills. Let me share some specific programs that could help address those areas.
